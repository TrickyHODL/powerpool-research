In this study, the possibility of minimizing losses during pool rebalancing was studied. The effectiveness of three strategies was studied for a period of 400 days with a 50-day start step and a 20-day strategy duration. An arbitrageur robot was programmatically modeled.

In the first strategy, the pool composition was changed immediately in one time step. In the second strategy, the weights were changed and the pool was rebalanced in equal parts within 20 days. In the third strategy, an algorithm was worked out to minimize losses by means of an uneven change in weights depending on the price movement that occurred in the market.

The comparison of strategies showed the effectiveness of the third strategy - the algorithm for minimizing losses.
